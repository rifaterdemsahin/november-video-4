# 🗺️ Roadmap and Constraints

## 2.1 🛠️ Platform & Infrastructure (Voice Over Integration)
> **Reference:** [Voice Over Script](../5_Symbols/voice_over.md)

### The "Unknown" to "Known" Bridge
- **Platform:** **GitHub** is the core platform.
    - **Developers:** Use **CodeSpaces** to pull repos and run environments (C++, C#, Java, Python).
    - **Non-Developers:** Use GitHub to capture requirements and contribute to "WIP Programming".
- **Infrastructure:** **200+ Repositories** serve as templates.
- **Concept:** **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** starts with "Vibe Programming" (defining the environment) to bridge the gap between unknown requirements and known delivery.
