The 10 times more jobs will come if the people are going to be able to assess themselves because these are all going to be the unknown roles that are coming to the marketplace and people really don't know. Once the invention of the car comes in, there are so many new sectors that got created.(...) It is just in unknown and the unknown is a good thing.

(...)

I see. So the delivery pilot is about helping people understand their current skills so they can adapt and find success in these unknown roles that AI will create, much like the car industry. That makes sense.(...) What sort of assessment are we talking about here? Is it a test or a different process?

(...)

This is all about doing an assessment on people's past experiences. Either they are a developer or non-developer, meaning either they are coming from a deterministic approach versus non-deterministic approach. I'm trying to get all of them into the same boat, first assessing them and then giving them trainings about AI which they decide on which trainings they should get. Then at the end doing workshops with them.

(...)

That's a very well structured approach. So you're first assessing people's backgrounds, whether they're technical or not, to understand their starting point, then providing tailored training to help them learn about AI and finally workshops to apply that knowledge. That really helps make the delivery pilot concrete.(...) What sort of outcomes are you hoping for from these workshops? What will participants be able to do once they've completed them?

(...)

So the workshops are all geared towards the 200 repositories that I was able to create and demonstrate the practical skills such as they want to learn Python. There's a Python project that they can create but the template is geni-

Eric, so the people who are coming from the white programming world, the juniors or non-developers, non-deterministic people will be able to come in and contribute and the developers who use the framework as an agentic framework will be able to capture what they are doing and the whole goal is as an enterprise they can work together. That's a really innovative approach.(...) So the workshops leverage your 200 plus repositories, providing practical template-based projects like Python ones that everyone can contribute to, regardless of their background, and the developers are using the framework as an agentic framework to capture what's being done. The goal is for enterprises to work together this way. That's a powerful vision. So how will you measure the success of these workshops? What will indicate that the goal of enterprises working together has been reached?

(...)

So the main thing is if they can turn back everything to the real, meaning if they have this AI security project that they are working on and they are able to do the exercise and turn the systems on is the goal. So this is the reason I called it a delivery pilot. They are delivering on the goals that they are mentioning. It can be writing a C sharp microservice, a Java microservice. It could be any IT project they want to take on.

(...)

Got it. So the success is measured by their ability to implement their AI security project and turn the systems on. It's about delivering on those specific goals, whether it's writing a C sharp microservice or any other IT project. That's a very practical and results-oriented measure of success.(...) So are there any specific features or functionalities you aim to showcase in these workshops?

(...)

So in the new world, as I mentioned, things are going to be unknown. So this

and plate structure that we are using on the delivery pilot workshops is we take on any project and we focus on delivering it. We really don't know what we are going to take on, but we have a generic method to be able to capture our goals, our imaginary world, the user interfaces that we go to, the environments that we are using, the formulas that we are getting from the AI, the symbols that are created by the AI and the semblance, the errors that are getting fixed, we create a gamified environment where we connect all the dots.

(...)

That's a really interesting concept. So the delivery pilot is about navigating unknown projects using a generic template-based approach that includes gamified elements to connect all the dots, from imaginary worlds to formulas from AI and even fixing errors. That sounds like a very immersive and practical way to learn. So what specific gamified elements are you planning to incorporate?(...) So what I'm trying to incorporate is such as in this talk, you are asking me questions that are not written on the prompter. The gamified elements are solving the problems and coming back to the real. If my goal is running a Python web server, my goal has to become deploying this on code spaces and turning it on. Could be an example or deploying it to my local or deploying to my premise and turning it on. And I'm going to do this as an enterprise, not just single entity myself, but everybody in the company.(...) That's a really insightful comparison. So the gamified elements are like the unscripted questions you're getting now. They push you to solve problems and relate everything back to the real world, like getting a Python web server up and running across an entire enterprise. It sounds like a very dynamic approach. So what's the biggest challenge you anticipate people will face while going through these gamified workshops?

So the biggest issue that the people are going to go through is they are going to realize that this could only work and only work if the people are able to use these systems and turn them on by endorsing the concept of the unknown and the non-worlds coming together. In the world of DevOps, while people worked on the projects, things were not known, they were always in the unknown world and people started creating the silos because people really don't want to go to an unknown world. With the rise of the AI, the skills are going to change, meaning from an I-skilled person, we are going to move to an X-skilled person, not an M-skilled person where one person learns multiple subjects, but people will be able to take one skill and be creative on a different skill set. So that is my vision, what this is going to lead.

(...)

That's a profound vision. It sounds like the biggest challenge will be overcoming the fear of the unknown and embracing the shift from I-skilled to X-skilled, where people apply their core skills to new areas. It's about breaking down silos and working collaboratively in a constantly evolving environment. That's quite a mindset shift. So what support will be provided during the workshops to help people make this transition? First of all, we do the assessments for the teams. We had this short questionnaire where I go through one-to-one with everybody who is taking that questionnaire. This is completely private. I will look at their prompts. I will look at their Git projects and assess where they are in the AI learning space. The second stage is they get mapped to the required trainings related to the AI, which are always getting updated. And the end is going through these workshops where they can do their projects on themselves, but with a company as well where they are getting a human feedback.

(...)

That's a very structured approach to support people.(...) So the support comes in three stages.(...) Initial, private questionnaires to assess their AI learning space, then tailored training based on those assessments, and finally, hands-on workshops with both personal and company-wide feedback. That seems very comprehensive. So what kind of feedback will participants receive during the workshops?

(...)

During the workshops, what they are going to see is, these systems will not turn on, such as, "I'm going to create a microservice on Kubernetes using Istio." This is a very complex system. Even with the help of the AI, the systems will tend to fail. So we have a section called "Semblance" and the way how to sort it out. And we are going to have multiple people that's coming on, on these projects to be able to sort it. The devs, we call them deterministic people, might be more inclined to solve it, but the non-dears, the business people, want to be able to make sure that they also understand what's going on with the Kubernetes and the Istio in these workshops. So what we want them is, we want them to be able to work together and break those silos in the companies, where we could not do that in the DevOps transformation. But with the rise of the AI, nobody has any excuse of not knowing some parts of the project. Right now, they have the AI to be able to support them.

(...)

That's a very realistic approach to problem solving. So participants will experience real world failures, like Kubernetes microservices failing to start, and work together, using AI as a support, to understand and resolve these issues. The aim is to break down silos and foster a collaborative understanding across deterministic and non-deterministic team members. That sounds like a highly effective way to learn and grow. So what tools or platforms will be used for these workshops?

(...)

For the workshops, the basic platform that I'm using is GitHub, because it is easy to put your requirements there as...

non-deterministic, non-de-person, and for a developer there is code spaces and being able to pull the repos and run different environments and run different use cases there from C++ to C sharp to Java to Python so it will give you an infrastructure escort.

(...)

That makes total sense! GitHub sounds like the perfect platform especially with code spaces for the developers allowing you to store project requirements for non-devs and provide infrastructure as code across various languages like C++ and C sharp Java and Python. That sounds incredibly flexible and powerful for the workshops so what kind of infrastructure is code will they be working with? The infrastructure as code will start with the vibe programming that is very critical and once they start doing the vibe programming I know that the developers, operations, systems, people in the companies are going to freak out but we talked about them so we have a structure called the environment and where the operations the developers can define them and can treat them so we are going to start from the unknown and meet with the known world. We are not going to always get a certificate and try to deliver a solution, no, everybody will be able to contribute and the non-devs will start doing their send boxes in the delivery pilot.

(...)

That's a really inclusive approach. Starting with WIP programming sounds like a great way to get everyone involved in the infrastructure as code and by allowing developers and operations people to define and tweak the environment you're really bridging the gap between the unknown and the known worlds. It's a hands-on way to encourage collaboration and move away from silos. That sounds like a very effective way to deliver the delivery pilot so what's your ultimate goal for the widespread adoption of this method?(...) I'm trying to create this lifestyle business for myself while I'm helping others as well. This business model that I...

created is going to be supported by paid assessments, which is around $50 per assessment and the daily workshops, which range from $500 to $1000 based on their location and based on their commitment. What I'm expecting from the companies is while they are doing their AI transformations, they do regular checks on themselves to assess themselves, to train themselves and to be able to do the workshops so they become self-sufficient and they are able to turn the systems on. So my goal is to automate myself out of the role so they complete the AI transformation.

(...)

That's a very entrepreneurial and sustainable business model you've designed, creating a lifestyle business while helping others through paid assessments and workshops. With the ultimate goal of automating yourself out of the role as companies become self-sufficient in their AI transformations is very innovative. It really highlights the focus on empowerment and sustainability for your clients. So what's the first step for a company interested in your services? Would they begin with the assessment?

(...)

Yes, I'm putting down an assessment link down below. They can go ahead and take it. And for the first time, I will give the half an hour one-to-one for them who is interested. I will definitely do it for them and also give them a free training so they will have a peek around it. And if they are interested on doing the workshops, leave their email to our contact list so I will contact them so we can take this further.

(...)

That's a great opportunity!(...) So anyone interested can click the assessment link provided and the first 10 will receive a complimentary half hour one-on-one session plus a free training.(...) And if they want to continue with the workshops, they can leave their email on the contact list. That's a very accessible way to get started with your AI transformation. I wish you the best of luck with this initiative.

(...)

Thank you very much. Is there anything else?

that you should ask for us to be able to publish this YouTube video.

(...)

Thank you. Before we publish, it might be helpful to briefly address any potential concerns viewers might have about the effectiveness of gamified learning for professional development. Perhaps you could mention some of the psychological principles underpinning the approach or success stories from previous participants that could add extra credibility.

(...)

All right, I am the main success principal on here. I did not have a college degree and I learned that by using the leverage for the certificates and online trainings that helped me build my career. But right now the cheese has moved and I realized that right now the companies are not looking for coders, but they are looking for magicians who is already being able to deliver projects on GitHub. So I created the concept as CVS code and packaged it in delivery pilot where the enterprises can use. So that is very, very critical. Everybody needs to move on from the mindset of the lectures, certificates to the hands-on deliveries where they can show their customers that they are able to deliver in an unknown world. So I'm the initial customer for this and I'm using this. I created more than 200 reposters on GitHub, which I will suggest you to do the same.(...) That's a really compelling success story. It highlights the shift from traditional education and certificates to a focus on hands-on delivery and creating tangible results, which is Till next video. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Take care.

(...)

Cheers. Thanks for the chat. Have a good one. Bye-bye.
